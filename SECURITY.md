Security Policy for the _DistCC Driver_ project
===============================================

Supported versions
------------------

Due to its somewhat trivial nature, this project does not ship with the concepts of "versions".
Only the latest built image, as available from the `master` branch, is considered "supported".



Private vulnerability reporting
-------------------------------

Please use [GitHub's security advisory](http://github.com/whisperity/distcc-driver/security/advisories/new) system associated with the repository to report a security issue with the project.
This ensures that the incident is given appropriate tracking, allows for controlled communication, and responsible disclosure.

For issues that do not affect user or system security, create a [normal issue](http://github.com/whisperity/distcc-driver/issues/new) instead!
