`distcc.sh` &emdash; DistCC remote auto-job script


Summary
-------

Automatically distribute a C/C++ compilation over a DistCC-based cluster with job-count load balancing.

    export DISTCC_AUTO_HOSTS="worker-1 worker-2 worker-3"
    source distcc.sh; distcc_build make target1 target2 ...


Description
-----------

This script allows remotely building C/C++ projects through a _distcc(1)_ cluster.
However, instead of requiring the user to manually configure `DISTCC_HOSTS`, which has a required and non-trivial format (such as specifying the number of jobs to dispatch to a server) and making sure that the called build system is also given an appropriate `--jobs N` parameter, this script automatically balances the available server list, prevents dispatching to servers that do not reply to jobs, and selects the appropriate job count to drive the build with.

It is expected to call this script by prefixing a build command with the wrapper function's name, and specifying the hosts where _distccd(1)_ servers are listening.
The called build tool should allow receiving a `-j` parameter, followed by a number.

    DISTCC_AUTO_HOSTS="server-1 server-2" distcc_build make foo

In this case, the real call under the hood will expand to something appropriate, such as:

    DISTCC_HOSTS="localhost/8 server-1/16,lzo server-2/8,lzo" make foo -j 32

Host specification
------------------

The contents of the `DISTCC_AUTO_HOSTS` environment variable is the primary configuration option that **MUST** be set by the user prior to using this script.
The host list is a whitespace separated list of individual worker host specification entries, which are composed of (usually) a host name and, optionally, the remote server's port number.

The value is expected to adhere to the following syntax:

~~~~
DISTCC_AUTO_HOSTS = AUTO_HOST_SPEC ...
AUTO_HOST_SPEC    = TCP_HOST
TCP_HOST          = [tcp://]HOSTNAME[:DISTCC_PORT[:STATS_PORT]]
HOSTNAME          = ALPHANUMERIC_HOSTNAME
                  | IPv4_ADDRESS
                  | IPv6_ADDRESS
~~~~

In the above grammar, the meaning of the individual non-terminals are as described below, with examples.

Exit codes
----------

When not indicated otherwise, the script will exit with the exit code of the build invocation command which was passed to `distcc_build`.
(In the above examples, this is the exit code of `make`.)
The actual build system might have and define various non-zero exit codes for error conditions, which should be looked up from the specific tool's documentation.

In addition, the main script may generate, prior to the execution of the
build tool, the following exit codes for error conditions:

| Exit code | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `96`      | Indicates an issue with the configuration of the execution environment, such as the emptiness of a mandatory configuration variable, or the lack of required system tools preventing normal function. |
| `97`      | There is not enough system memory (RAM) available on the local computer to run the requested number of local compilations, and no remote workers were available.                                      |
